# landing-page

This is a basic landing page created using HTML and CSS as part of The Odin Project curriculum. 

This project has helped me consolidate my previous learnings from The Odin Project, and I have even learned new things along the way as I worked through creating the entire HTML and CSS from scratch as a beginner.
